===================
Importance Sampling
===================

Sample from distribution q(x) and take the expectation of p(x)/q(x)f(x) to get the expectation of f(x) under p(x)
Can be done for any distribution q(x) but if q(x) is very different from p(x)f(x) then the variance of the estimator will be high
